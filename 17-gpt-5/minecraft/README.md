MiniCraft (browser voxel sandbox)

Run
- npm install
- npm run dev

Controls
- Click “Play” to lock the mouse
- Move: WASD
- Jump: Space (hold Shift to sprint)
- Look: Mouse
- Break block: Left click (or Q)
- Place block: Right click (or E) on a face

Notes
- You start a few blocks above ground. Gravity, collisions, and jumping are implemented so you won’t fall through blocks.
- World is a small hilly grassy area; blocks are fully opaque and have a dark border for visual clarity.
- Placing a block where your body is would trap you, so it’s blocked.
