{
  "level1": [
    {"code": "<EuroVoc level‑1 descriptor>"},
    {"code": "<optional second>"},
    …
  ]
}

────────────────────── GUIDELINES ───────────────────────
• **Exhaustive recall** – missing a relevant descriptor is an error.  
• Typical acts include **2 – 6 descriptors**.  
• Only include a descriptor if the text clearly supports it.  
• If none apply, return `"level1": []`.

Precision guardrails  
• Do **not** add *EUROPEAN UNION* just because the document is EU‑issued.  
• Use *law* only when legal substance or jurisprudence is central.  
• Use *geography* when a specific region or PDO place name is a core focus.

Heuristics for sparsely predicted topics  
• Protected‑origin names (PDO/PGI) → **geography**  
• Industrial policy, emission limits → **industry**  
• Energy supply, renewables targets → **energy**  
• Training, media, digital literacy → **education and communications**  
• Macro‑economy, taxation, GDP targets → **economics**  
• Research funding, science programmes → **science**  
• EU agencies, UN bodies, NATO → **international organisations**
